# CineDapp

* CineDApp, a decentralized application under development by the authors of this document, provides a platform for new upcoming talent to fulfill their dreams and become true entertainment industry stars.

* This application allows users to list and pitch their film ideas, as well as seek funding from individuals who will act as co-producers. Since it is decentralized, it eliminates numerous market ills such as :
1. central hegemony and nepotism. 
1. It introduces accountability, allowing all partners to see how the project's funds are distributed. 
1. The movie's investment would supply investors with exclusive tokens that can be used for a variety of uses, including benefit-sharing and stock trading.

* A user's sample pitch includes the project name, token name, estimated project date, a brief synopsis, and a thorough description of the proposal. Any investor can get a quick overview or a more in-depth look at the project. This functionality allows platform users to participate in a project related to their area of interest without having to learn about it in depth.
